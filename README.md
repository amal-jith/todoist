## About The Project

This <b>ToDoist<b> app, a daily app which have login, logout and user registration features which allow users to create separate accounts and create thier todo list. This have the features such as search options, completed task, 
and task details.  An improved one.
  And finally, this project is deployed using PythonAnywhere.
  
## How This Helps Me?
I was curious to create a simple login, logout faeture to a todo app. In that case, it allows users o create their individual tasks. More HTML and CSS styling to the background. Since the first project was done when I was started
  to learn Python so some of the additional features where misisng . Connecting MySQL database in server. Deploying.
  <p>I was vey happy that I am able to implement a basic login feature by learning. </p>

## Languages and Tools Used
-Python Django
-HTML
-CSS styling
